## Overview of Project

This project is to implement an object detection model application by using You Only Look Once v3 ([YOLOv3](https://pjreddie.com/yolo/)) to identify and locate objects by means of voice command. Suppose a user asks the app about the whereabouts of an object.

- If the object is present, the app, with the help of Google Text-to-Speech (TTS), informs the user about the total number of objects found and their directions. For example, the model reports, "The cup is present to your left but close to the center." 
- If the object is not present, an audio file is played saying, "The object you are searching for is not found."

This model can help a visually impaired user to find objects easily as shown in the following scenarios:

![Object detection scenarios](/images/samples/solutions/object-detection/object-detection-scenario.png)

Required object found (left-hand side image):

- A visually impaired user asks the app to find a bench.
- The app detects the bench in front and indicates that it is found.
  
Required object NOT found (right-hand side image):

- A visually impaired user asks the app to find a laptop.
- The app does not detect any laptop devices and indicates that it is not found.

## Object Detection Model

The object detection model is executed according to the following steps:

![Object detection model diagram](/images/samples/solutions/object-detection/object-detection-model.jpg)

1. A user speaks through the microphone to search for an object.
2. The user speech is converted to text by using Google Speech-to-Text (STT).
3. The trained YOLOv3 model is used for object detection.
4. The object specified by the user is matched with the objects found.
5. The app speaks out the status of the objects found (their presence and directions).
6. The app displays the photo of the object.

## Prepare a Target device

You must prepare a target device, Raspberry Pi 4 (RPi 4), flashed with a webOS OSE image. Set your device up by performing the instructions mentioned at [Building webOS OSE](https://www.webosose.org/docs/guides/setup/building-webos-ose/). After you have performed the procedure, you have a fully functional webOS OSE target device. Note down the IP address of the device.

{{< note >}}
On the target device, create a Google account. This Google account is used later to configure the required Google services.
{{< /note >}}

### Connect Hardware Devices

You need to connect the following items to the target device:

- USB headphone
- HD USB camera (better resolution required for better image detection)

![HW connection](/images/samples/solutions/object-detection/object-detection-hw-connection.jpeg)

### Configure the Audio Device

Configure the audio output device. By default, the audio output is played on the USB headset. However, if you want the output on a Bluetooth speaker, follow these steps:

1. Connect to the target device.
2. Create a file named `.asoundrc` at path `~/` and add the following content:

    ``` bash
    pcm.!default {
        type asym
        playback.pcm {
            type plug
            slave.pcm pulse
        }
        capture.pcm {
            type plug
            slave.pcm "hw:1,0"
        }
    }
    ```

    This is an audio configuration file that handles playback audio on the runtime pulse availability of the audio device that is attached to the target device. For example, Bluetooth speakers and USB headsets.

3. Save the file.

### Download YOLO Components

On the target device, prepare the following directories:

- Create a directory named `ObjectDetection` in the `/home/root/` directory.
- Create a directory named `picture` in the `/home/root/ObjectDetection/` directory.
- Create a directory named `ObjectDetectionImage` in the `/media/internal/` directory to store processed images.

You also need to download the following package files to the target device:

## Install the App

Install the app on the target device by using the webOS OSE CLI from your local PC.

On your local PC, follow these steps:

1. Install the webOS OSE CLI.

    ``` shell
    $ npm install -g @webosose/ares-cli
    ```

2. Register the target device.

    ``` shell
    $ ares-setup-device
    ```

    ![Registering an RPi4 board](/images/samples/solutions/object-detection/object-detection-setup-register-rpi4.png)

    As shown in the above figure, select the add option and fill in the details of your RPi4 device and type "yes" for Save.

3. Download the following IPK to your local PC: `com.app.objectviewer_0.0.1_all.ipk`.

4. Go to the directory where the IPK is downloaded, and install the IPK on the target device.

    ``` shell
    $ ares-install --device target com.app.objectviewer_0.0.1_all.ipk
    ```

## Launch the App

On the target device, launch the installed app by following these steps:

1. Go to the app directory.

    ``` shell
    $ cd /home/root/ObjectDetection/
    ```

2. Download the `CamImage.py` file and copy it to the `/home/root/ObjectDetection/` directory.

3. Run the app.

    ``` shell
    $ python3 CamImage.py
    ```

4. Specify the object to be found by stating the hot word as "LG". For example, "LG find umbrella and bottle."

5. An image that labels all the identified objects, is displayed on the monitor via the app.

    ![Demo scenario detecting an umbrella](/images/samples/solutions/object-detection/object-detection-demo-umbrella.jpg)

    You can see that the umbrella and bottle are identified.

6. If the object requested by the user is present in the image, the audio output is "Umbrella found towards the left, bottle found towards right". If the object is not present, the audio output is "Umbrella and bottle not found".

## Code Implementation

The source code for the object detection app is available at the [samples](https://github.com/webosose/samples) git repository. To get a deeper understanding, refer to the snippets provided below, which explain some important parts of the implementation.

### Importing Libraries

Includes the necessary libraries on the target device when the program runs and executes.

``` python
import cv2
import numpy as np
import requests
import os
import pyaudio
import wave
from collections import Counter
```

### talk()

This function helps to convert a text file into mp3 audio file and plays it to the user.

1. This function is called with the passed parameter "text", which contains the output text.
2. This function calls the Google TTS library then converts the text into mp3 file.
3. The mpg123 player plays the converted mp3 file.

``` python
def talk(text):
    from gtts import gTTS
    import os
    mytext = text
    language = 'en'
    myobj = gTTS(text=mytext, lang=language, slow=False)
    myobj.save("welcome.mp3")
    os.system("mpg123 " + "welcome.mp3")
```

### take_alter_command()

This function is called when the user makes voice command.

1. This function calls the `voicein` function recursively until it collects the right input from the user.
2. The `voicein` function sets the parameters, such as chunk and frame, to record the voice.
3. This function initiates recording for 5 seconds and stops recording. After that, the recording is saved as a .wav file.
4. With the help of Google Cloud, this function converts the .wav audio file to the text.
5. If the user has not given any input voice, then the text must be empty and this functions repeatedly calls the `voicein` function.
6. If the text is not empty, it gets converted into a lowercase text.
7. From the lowercase text this function tries to identify the keyword "LG".

    a. If the keyword "LG" is present in the text, this function returns the text for further operations.

    b. Else, it repeats calling the `voicein` function.

``` python
def take_alter_command():
    def voicein():
        CHUNK = 515
        FORMAT = pyaudio.paInt16
        CHANNELS = 2
        RATE = 44100
        RECORD_SECONDS = 5
        WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME = "output.wav"

        p = pyaudio.PyAudio()

        stream = p.open(format=FORMAT,
                        channels=CHANNELS,
                        rate=RATE,
                        input=True,
                        frames_per_buffer=CHUNK)
        print("* recording")
        
        frames = []

        for i in range(0, int(RATE / CHUNK * RECORD_SECONDS)):
            data = stream.read(CHUNK)
            frames.append(data)
        print("* done recording")
        
        stream.stop_stream()
        stream.close()
        p.terminate()

        wf = wave.open(WAVE_OUTPUT_FILENAME, 'wb')
        wf.setnchannels(CHANNELS)
        wf.setsampwidth(p.get_sample_size(FORMAT))
        wf.setframerate(RATE)
        wf.writeframes(b''.join(frames))
        wf.close()
        
        from google.cloud import speech
        import io

        client = speech.SpeechClient()
        speech_file = "/home/root/ObjectDetection/output.wav"
       
        with io.open(speech_file, "rb") as audio_file:
            content = audio_file.read()

        audio = speech.RecognitionAudio(content=content)
        config = speech.RecognitionConfig(
            encoding=speech.RecognitionConfig.AudioEncoding.LINEAR16,
            sample_rate_hertz=44100,
            language_code="en-US",
            audio_channel_count=2,
        )

        response = client.recognize(config=config, audio=audio)

        # Each result is for a consecutive portion of the audio. Iterate through
        # them to get the transcripts for the entire audio file.
        
        if len(response.results) == 0:
            return voicein()
        else: 
            for result in response.results:
                # The first alternative is the most likely one for this portion.
                
                print(u"Transcript: {}".format(result.alternatives[0].transcript))
                resultvoice = (format(result.alternatives[0].transcript))
                resultvoice = resultvoice.lower()
                if 'lg' in resultvoice:
                    outputvoice = resultvoice.replace('lg', '')       
                    return outputvoice
                else:
                    return take_alter_command()
                return resultvoice
    text = voicein()
    return text;
```

### run_lg()

This function helps processing user voice input and runs the YOLO DNN model to process the result.

1. InputCommand calls the `take_alter_command` function and takes the input from the user.
2. InputCommand converts the input text into lowercase and changes the exception words like "potted plant" to "pottedplant" as per `coco.names` file.
3. The input text is then broken into single words and kept in a list named `ObjectToFind`.
4. The YOLO configuration file and the weights file are then loaded by using DNN. This class allows to create and manipulate comprehensive artificial neural networks.
5. All the names from the `coco.names` file is then stored in a list named `classes`.
6. Then some operations to handle the camera are executed by using the camera2 service API.
7. Then the captured images are processed and then the detected objects are labeled in those images accordingly.
8. The processed images are stored locally. 
9. If the confidence is more than 0.5 (50%), then a rectangular box is created around the object with the object name and confidence score and the object name is added to the "items" list.
10. The object detection app then shows the processed image with the rectangular box and labels.

``` python
def run_lg():
    InputCommand = take_alter_command()
    InputCommand = InputCommand.lower()
    if "potted plant" in InputCommand:
        InputCommand = InputCommand.replace("potted plant", "pottedplant")
